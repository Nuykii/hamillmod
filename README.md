# nuyKii's simple foods a.k.a Hamill Mod

Welcome to the github for the n's simple foods mod

### What does this mod add?

This mod aims to backport the foods of regular Minecraft for the animals present in BTA!, that means Chicken Mutton and Beef, as well as make them dropable by the corresponding mods and cookable.

### What's currently implemented? What will you do next?

For now, you have access to raw Beef, Chicken and Mutton in the creative menu as well as the cooked variants. Now the only thing left is to implement mixin so you can actually get them.

Next I will try to backport melon as well, but that's farther into the future.
