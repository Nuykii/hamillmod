# nuyKii's simple foods a.k.a Hamill Mod

Welcome to the github for the n's simple foods mod!!

### What does this mod add?

This mod aims to backport or rework the foods of regular Minecraft for the animals present in BTA!, that means Chicken, Mutton, Pork and Beef, as well as make them dropable by the corresponding mobs, cookable AND stackable!!

### What's currently implemented? What will you do next?

Sheep drop Mutton, Cows drop Beef, Chicken drop Chicken and Pigs drop Pork!! These are stackable up to 16 (intentional design choice after taking into account the absence of the hunger bar), cookable, eatable, throwable, burnable....

What next?? I'm thinking of adding my own personal choices of food, I was thinking of Hazelnuts growing on trees much like Cherries; mix those with cocoa and you've some Nutella!!

Oh and melons too I guess.
