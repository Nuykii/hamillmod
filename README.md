# nuyKii's simple foods a.k.a Hamill Mod

Welcome to the github for the n's simple foods mod

### What does this mod add?

This mod aims to backport the foods of regular Minecraft for the animals present in BTA!, that means Chicken Mutton and Beef, as well as make them dropable by the corresponding mods and cookable.

### What's currently implemented? What will you do next?

For now, you have access to raw Beef, Chicken and Mutton in the creative menu. My plan for the next commit is to have the cooked versions also available. The next big step is making the raw variants dropable by mobs which will include some Mixin coding.
Then it will just be making the food cookable and voila! You'll have all the food you need.

Next I will try to backport melon as well, but that's farther into the future.
