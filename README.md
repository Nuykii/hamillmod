# nuyKii's simple foods a.k.a Hamill Mod

Welcome to the github for the n's simple foods mod!!

### What does this mod add?

This mod is a quality of life mod that does a few things: add more food (for now, you get food from cows, pigs, chickens and sheep), make the base game food stackable and adds craftable recipes, such as stews (Beef Bourguignon, Chicken Tikka Massala and Irish Stew for now).

### What's next?

Next is more craftable recipes as well as more cooking utensils and items, and (one day!) more animals and crops meaning more food and more recipes overall. Currently I am working on the Melon.
